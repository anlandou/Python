*Introduction

  --> What is Python? 

	A high-level programming language, meaning it is programmer friendly and 
not machine friendly :: easy to write, easy to understand 
 
    Ex: 
	a = 10 
	b = 20
	c = 30 if a > b else 40
	print(c)
    It is also a general purpose language :: able to create all types of programs 
    
    Founder :: Guido Van Rossum, released 1991 

    Benefits: 
	
      Concise code 
      Easy to understand
      AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Data Science 
      IoT


To learn any language start with Hello World!
 Ex: 

#print Hello World

 
print("Hello World); 

num1= 4, num2= 3 // No other language accepts this type of syntax 

//You do not have to declare a variable in python, this is what is known as a dynamically typed programming language. Some other examples of other languages that are dynamic are: JavaScript, Ruby, etc. 

print("the sum is: " , num1+num2); 

C ---> functional programming language // Not object oriented 

c++, Java ---> OOP // Reusability, inheritance 

Perl, Shell Script ---> Scripting Languages Group of lines, one by one


Although Python is a mixture of all: 
      				
				- It borrowed functional programming from C
				- Object-Oriented Programming from C++ 
				- Scripting language from Perl, Shell Script 
				- Lastly Modular (Don't worry about this one too much) 

Basically, Python is an All Rounder! 

So what is meant by scripting language? 

		-Every thing is done line by line. No functions, no classes 

Functional Programming : 
			
		- def fun(): 

OOP: 
	- class Test: 
		
		def fun(): 
T = fun();

    	
*Application areas of Python 

		-Desktop Applications 
		-Web Applications //using frameworks
		-Network Applications // client server applications
		-Game Development Applications
		-Data Analysis
		-ML, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, AI, IoT...

*Features of Python 

   -- Simple and easy to learn

   -- Freeware and open source ---> No license required, No fee (freeware) anyone can use --> Owner Python Software Foundation NOT for profit 
    ---> (Open Source) Open to everyone ---> customizable, able to edit and make changes ---> making multiple flavors available 

   -- High Level Programming Language --> programmer friendly --> no worries of memory management, garbage collector, etc. 

   -- Platform Independent ---> can run on any software/ platform (operating system)
          ----> write once, run anywhere 

   -- Portability --> easy to transport --> from one platform to another 
     
   -- Dynamically Typed ---> assign and use the same variable multiple times  

   -- Both procedure oriented and object oriented 

   -- Interpreted --> just runs not compiled 

   -- Extensible  --> other language applications can be used in python 

   -- Embedded    --> can use python application in other programming language applications 

   -- Extensive Library --> Rich library ---> rich life support 
   -- etc. 
      
*Limitations of Python

          -- Bad choice for mobile applications 
	  -- Enterprise Applications... like banking applications, telecom, and etc. 
	  -- Performance is low because it is interpreted language	

*Flavors of Python 
   
    	  --Cpython: C Language Python	
	  --JPython: Java language python 
          --Anaconda Python: To work with large volumes of data 
	  --etc. 

*Python Versions
  
      		0.9.0 --> First Version 
		1.0.0 --> Second Version 
		2.0.0 --> Third Version 
		3.0.0 --> Fourth Released 2008 
		3.8.2 --> What I have 

*Identifiers

   A name in python for variables, class, methods, and etc. are known as identifiers used for identification purposes 

    --Rules to create identifiers: 
    
     1. a-z 
     2. A-Z 
     3. 0-9 
     4. _ --> underscore 

                                cash = 10 (Good)
				ca$h = 10 (Not allowed) 
                                all@hands = 10 (Not Allowed) 

     Identifiers cannot start with digits 

     Python is a case sensitive language 
     No length limit for python identifiers 

Check this out: 

		x --> normal variable 
	       _x --> Protected Variable 
	      __x --> Private Variable 
	    __x__ --> Magic Variable // predefined identifiers 

That's very interesting!

*Reserved Words 
 
    ---Words that cannot be used for any other purpose than what they are meant for e.g if ---> reserved of if statements 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 33 reserved words in python: 

Boolean:
1. True 
2. False
3. None 

Operators:
4. and
5. or
6. not
7. is

Conditionals: 
8. if
9. elif
10.else

Control flows: 
11. While
12.For
13.break 
14.continue
15.return 
16.in
17.yield 

Exceptions:
18.try 
19.except
20.finally
21.raise
22.assert

Etc: 
23.import
24.from
25.as
26.class
27.def
28.pass
29.global
30.nonlocal
31.lambda
32.del
33.with
-----------------------------ALL CONTAIN ALPHABET SYMBALS----------------------------


*Data Types

--Data types are automatically determined by the Python Virtual Machine --so need for data type declaration 

Int 
Float 
Complex
Bool 
Str 

List 
Tuple 
Set 
Frozen set 
Dict 

Bytes
Bytearray
Range
None 


Everything in python is an object!
